1. Write program in stages, making sure you use good object oriented design, test all
testable classes, document thoroughly, and write thorough report for each stage.

- Stage 3 - Add playlist panel and other visual cues for user.
			Playlist panel: JPanel that adds title names to playlist as files are opened
							Background/foreground colours of titles to indicate selection
							Double clicking of titles to play them
							Selection of corresponding titles when user selects different track
							Add previous/next menu items
							
- Stage 4 - Added new My_Track and Playlist classes for better playlist synchronization.
			Add importing of multiple tracks?
			Testing

- Stage 5 - Added skins class and changing skins functionality to menu bar
			Added ID3 track title information to playlist when available
			Added tooltip to tracks in playlist to display artist and album information
			Added currently playing track information

Stage 6 - Add support for new file formats, possibly video

Bugs:

1. When in fullscreen mode, if you open new track goes back to small screen
2. Cursor changes back to default when calling skins functions for a short while
