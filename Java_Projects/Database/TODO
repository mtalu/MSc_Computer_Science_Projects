1. Develop each stage using learned OO design methods, don't look at other stages until stage complete so that you get practice refactoring 
2. Possibly apply a test-driven development, i.e. test cases/methods before actual methods
3. Deal with potential errors appropriately using exceptions, error messages and possibly assert statements.
4. Comment classes and methods thoroughly
5. Keep a snapshot of each completed stage along with report describing the stage, design decisions you made, any refactoring
	you had to do and any particularly interesting issues that arose during implementation.
	
	
	Notes:
	-Finish types extension and report
	-Do extensions and follow the steps above
